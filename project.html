                        Participants joined the research study by voluntarily signing up through a Google Sheet distributed to them. Twenty-five students enrolled in the IOE 465 course at the University of Michigan were sampled for this experiment. During the signup process, participants were able to denote whether they were able to ingest caffeine.
